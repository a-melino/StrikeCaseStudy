Module 1 Assignment - Strike Case Study

## Overview

Strike is a payments comapny founded by Jack Mallers in 2019. The company offers instant global payments using the Bitcoin network.


## Business Activities

Transacting over existing payment rails such as credit card comapnies, bank transfers, or money wires results in high fees for the user, especially with cases of remittances to foreign countries. There is also a lack of privacy and the need to trust a third party in order for the transaction to be processed.

The intended customer base can technically be anyone that would like to use bitcoin as a payment network. The customers who would see the greatest benenfit from using Strike though would be those who send remittances back to their home country, which most often is a developing nation. Currently they would have to pay upwards of 15-20% to a comapny like Western Union in order to get a money transfer back to their families back home. 

They do not collect any spread on the Bitcoin that is bought, sold, or trasacted through their system.

Lightning network - this greatly speeds up the transaction speed which makes competing with the likes of Visa and banks possible as the underlying base bitcoin notwork would not be able to process transactions at a sufficient speed for this business to work.


## Landscape

The rise of cryptocurencies as an alternative to traditional fiat currencies and legacy banking systems. With Bitcoin in partocular, the rise of the Lightning network has been crucial for a company such as Strike.
